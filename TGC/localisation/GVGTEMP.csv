EVTDESC34501;Hello User, you have selected to play on the Political Rework branch. This branch is for testing purposes only, if you were intending to have a normal run please switch over the the Dev branch instead. That said if you did come here intentionally this branch is focussed on overhauling the election system of democratic countries by making the party loyalty mechanic have an actual purpose. You are supposed to use national focusses to steer party loyalty in the way that you want to, while events might try to turn loyalty in a way that you want to prevent. This can be counteracted by using your national focusses to incite a negative loyalty change for an ideology in the affected province. Feel free to play around with the mechanic and let me know if you have any suggestions or bug reports on the TGC Discord. -GeneralVonGelre;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
